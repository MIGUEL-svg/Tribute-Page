    <p>"To the graduating class of 2014, you are moments away from graduating. Moments away from beginning your journey through life. Moments away from starting to change the world — for the better. It will not be easy.

      But, YOU are the class of 2014, the class that can affect the lives of 800 million people in the next century.
      
      Start each day with a task completed. Find someone to help you through life. Respect everyone.
      
      Know that life is not fair and that you will fail often. But if take you take some risks, step up when the times are toughest, face down the bullies, lift up the downtrodden and never, ever give up — if you do these things, then the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today.
      
      And what started here will indeed have changed the world — for the better."</p>
